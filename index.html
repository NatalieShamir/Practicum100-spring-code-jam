            People know me as a party animal but actually I really enjoy some
            alone time in my garden or walking around graveyards.

            I am adventurous and considers myself lucky. For example, I mined some
            Bitcoin in the early 2010s and that bought me a house a few years
            later.

                Terry was raised in a an area of greater Boston. Terry has made a
                few attempts to become a programmer and tried out different online
                courses and bootcamps but never succeeded. Then, he met Elise, a
                programming guru. So now he's grown more serious about it and
                hopes to make it all the way through Practicum. However, his
                motivation can be a little unstable and he often gets distracted
                by his versatile other interests in life.
